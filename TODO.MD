## Release

- Make sure TiC integration is balanced and just right (currently partially done)

## Future Updates

- More API features for addon creators or integration with other mods
- Shooting Star spawns should be reworked to only spawn up to an x amount per night, star showers will possibly keep the current system instead
- Meteor Rework: Meteors will only impact the ground and deal damage if it is being followed, otherwise they despawn. Meteors will also fall more slowly. See AS shooting star's for an example of this
- Enchantment Rework: Rework for Lunar Edge and Lunar Shield while also introducing Solar counterparts
- New system for allowing special mobs to spawn during events?
- Unique purpose for Red Giant (potentially inspired by SCP-001)
- Add fancier and more unique particles, vignette effects in some other areas as well
- Alien Creeper variants causing different effects when exploding
- Harken Scythe integration (Mechanical Scythe)
- Meteor Summoners like the original meteors mod, these will be creative only
- Stellar Protector Mob
- Moon Slime Mob
- Kitty Comets?
- Something to completely prevent meteors from spawning, like the Meteor Shield from the old meteors mod?
- Update textures for special moons
- Might be fun to be able to sneak + right-click beam swords to toggle them on and off
- Make sure endgame content is balanced just right
- Set bonus tooltip can be changed to be much more intuitive where it shows which pieces of the set are equipped and what the set does. See Botania armor for a good example of this. (1/4 Set Bonus: Water Breathing)
- Rework Frezarite, Kreknorite, and Tektite sets to block a set of configurable potion effects when the full set is worn
- Replace 'Star Air' with a cleaner approach
- Some textures still need to be polished up and armor textures still need to be updated to be consistent
- Rename all class files
- Rework config file
- New attributes for Frezarite, Kreknorite, and Tektite to provide an effect when hit
