## Release

- Setup ConfigAnytime if any mixins become configurable
- Ensure the meteor detector works correctly, it was previously reported that they keep pointing to older meteor crashes
- Should check and see if the sky event mixins don't cause any incompatibilities with mods like Astral Sorcery
- Should check which config options and misc features are worth keeping
- Rebalance recipes for endgame content
- Tektite Gem Clusters should be an additional drop rather than a replacement, this will prevent smelting enchantments from making it never drop
